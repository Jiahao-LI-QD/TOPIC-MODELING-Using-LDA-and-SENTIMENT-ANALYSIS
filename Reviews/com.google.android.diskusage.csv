com.avast.android.cleaner,John Slenes,Note - I'm enrolled in a PAID app for 10 devices. Nearly useless android installation process. Tells me permission is missing but won't explain what permission is needed nor accept the permission change. Clinking the permission arrow gets a long time running rotating circle. No idea if it's done anything of value or not. That occurs on more than one of the steps. Stumbled across way to turn access on - only by luck - instructions = USELESS. I would recommend NOT buying app. May well seek refund or CC charge back if it's performance doesn't get much better ASAP. It's now hung at 17 % analyzing. FAR too many seeming screw ups.,1

com.mobisystems.fileman,arcata company,All the reviews are very positive I downloaded this because anything that is not Google has to be good however I must have missed the part where it says it cost $30 so I will be deleting this app however it will still probably save me money compared to Google files that will delete important information,1
com.mobisystems.fileman,Brian K,I am happy with this app but it doesn't seem to recognise .torrent files. I don't like that I have to switch to another file explorer just so I can initiate my torrent downloads. Please fix. Otherwise it is a very good application.,5
