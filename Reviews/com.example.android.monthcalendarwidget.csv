com.google.android.calendar,Resonance of Illumination - Ambition of Void,What a sad regression. I don't care about the schedule-view. It's useless. Also I seem to be stupid or something but aren't digital calendars supposed to AUTOMATICALLY notify you when something is coming up? Why do I need to manually assign notifications to every little thing? Who signed off on this and what is up with this worrying trend of over-development where products no longer properly do the things they were initially designed for? Just why do people keep ruining perfectly good things?,1

It still shows double reminders even after marking them as done and deleting them. Please resolve this issues cuz it's such good app to keep track of everything.,1

I read someone else wrote a similar review, then read the companies response. Restore purchase and it should fix it. I wanted to say it fixed mine, the app is fully restored.

com.itbenefit.android.calendar,Robert Lujan,"Was an amazing application and I loved everything about it. But aparently they can change from a one time purchase to a subscription and decide your license is no longer valid in a greedy attempt to force more money out of you. This is theft, plain and simple. I bought a license for this software as a one time purchase. I'd make this app myself before I let you steal from me and re-uy this one. Maybe I'll take your source code to do it too. That would be what they call ironic wouldn't it? 😡😡😡",3

It's disappointing when streamline software such as Google Calendar fails to give customizability to it's users. But that's when others come in to pick up the slack, and IT Benefit nailed it with this one. It's simple and effective and creates a visual that's easy on the eyes. I'm going to review the pro features at a later date, but for now I'm certain it's a worthwhile investment.",5

I'll gladly rate 5 stars, if this choosing & making your own colors for events can also be for all calendar events. This stinks. With my mind, EVERY event needs a different color in my calendar, or I'll never ""see"" it. Help!",1

com.itbenefit.android.calendar,T. W.,"I expected more from this widget, especially since I paid for it. I really hope that the option of choosing colors per event is going to be added. I use the small frame on my phone home screen so adding distinctive colors for each event of that day would really help to quickly see what's up for that day. I'm not sold on it completely. At this point it's not really worth the price asked.",3
com.itbenefit.android.calendar,Hannah Cascarano,"I was reading reviews and one person recommended to add some color for all the different types of events you have, like for example, the days you work, or people's birthdays. It helps us quicker differentiate things on the calendar. Plus, it looks nice. It really is a deal breaker for me so, good suggestion! Although, do I really have to pay for it? I'm guessing all those options in grey are what Id get if Id pay for it, right?",3
com.itbenefit.android.calendar,"R Josef Eugen Stewart, MSc, PhD","A very well-planned, organised, and best of all- design-friendly calendar app. It's fantastic because it's user-changeable (meaning I can adapt it according to my phone's screen display and it works very well that way).

I don't see why I need a big day/month/date underneath a calendar with the current day marked. Aside from that, I don't do subscription payments. It's not even a full app. How much can be updated from one year to the next in a calendar widget? I can't really find huge fault in it's operation, but it's not the best out there by any means.",3

The problem wasn't with the widget but changes they made to the energy savings in the new version. After a quick email to the developer I was able to fix it. *** HOW TO FIX *** It is very easy to fix the problem. Just add it as an exception to energy saving and restart your phone. If you are unfamiliar with your phones setting, try googling ""dontkillmyapp"".",5

com.itbenefit.android.calendar,Kristina Smith,I love this widget so far! I use Google calendar and like it so much more than than the Samsung calendar.

com.itbenefit.android.calendar,Gregory Eaton,"A nice simple widget with enough customization options to make it look good with any launcher and color scheme.

I highly recommend getting the paid version of this app!!",5

The widget may seem a little confusing at first, but you should get the hang of it in just a few trys and then customization possibilities are up to your imagination.

I'd suggest to allow for the typeface of the month name to shrink with the widget. I like having a 3x3 size, but most half of the widget is taken up by ""September"" because the typeface doesn't shrink and so it takes up 2 lines.  A quick fix would be to display only the three-letter abbreviation for the month, as this would at least prevent the month name/year from taking up 2 lines. Other than that, awesome app!",4

com.moonly.android,Kim Watkins Rocks,I love almost everything about this app. I can not find how to change from monthly to yearly and I also feel the daily meditation could be less repetitive.

com.moonly.android,Rebecca,"I had high hopes for this app but after having it for a few weeks, it seems like a lot of repeat information. Also, I wish there were notifications because I tend to forget about it. Trying to get in the habit of following the moon calendar and notifications would help. Maybe I am missing them? I would love more new information. I bought the lifetime subscription and now feel kinda like it was a waste. Update: Several months later and no change. Wish there was a refund available!",1
com.moonly.android,MiKaylie Rae,"I enjoy using this app and I think it is worth the lifetime payment, however, my only complaint is that the payment cannot cross platforms. I purchased the lifetime subscription with my iPhone but recently switched to android and found out that I would have to pay again. If there was a login of some sort I think that would benefit people who wish to download the app on multiple platforms that are not under the same operating system.

com.moonly.android,Nerea Lasa,"Really nice. Art style is beautiful, has a short explanation of the moon placement. A daily affirmation, access to some runes (full access with subscription), how they work and meanings; a section full of information on other matters and healing music/meditation.

com.moonly.android,Lauren Brunney,The moon sign calendar is incorrect.,2
com.moonly.android,Nichole Davis,Not worth the $29.99 for the lifetime pass. It advertises like it will help you find your totem animal. It advertises like it's going to give you affirmations. It doesn't actually do any of that. I want a refund.,1

My only concern is about how many things are locked to premium members. There are some features that would be very useful to me if it wasn't excluded from non premium members. And some of the limitations are just dumb. And also. fix the glitching when I'm trying to scroll through a multiple page thing where it stops letting me scroll and it crashes the app. But otherwise, AMAZING",5

It was why I originally got it, but I kept it anyway because of everything else, I just wish they would fix that one thing.",5

com.moonly.android,Kim Baker,"Beautiful artwork in this app. It is a good source for those who follow Eastern thought but i would prefer the option to choose other paths of practice. Another tiny issue I have is the grammar. I have discovered quite a lot of misspelled words and incidents of confusing sentence structure.

So I reached out to the Instagram acaccount. Someone replied and then I got an email back that did not solve my problem. So I replied to the email and again no response. It doesn't seem like it would be that hard to monitor the help email account but I guess it is for them. Then they ask me to write the same address they didn't respond to before. 🤦‍♀️,1

com.moonly.android,reetashree,the best moon app,5
com.moonly.android,Skjaldmaer67,Kind of disappointed that in order to use the app fully you want a month fee. I have paid for 2 apps like this and ended up with a different phone that didn't support them. So i was out money and was seeing if the developer could make available for all android phones but was told no... I had it installed but not keeping it due these reasons...,1

com.moonly.android,TeaBaby Little,The ad...just the ad,1

com.moonly.android,Emily Hathcock,perfect app for daily and reference use! I've learned so much,5
com.moonly.android,Carrie Beth McWithey,"Can't really do much with the free version... Every click brings up options to purchase the paid versions... So I can't really tell if I'd enjoy the paid versions, since I'm not sure what the app offers. Catch 22 i suppose lol.",1
com.moonly.android,Chasing Avalon,"I absolutely adore this app.... BUT. If you ever switch from an Android to an Apple phone, you'll lose everything. I've been trying to get my account back for a solid month now with no results. Extremely disappointing. You should be able to log in so that you can at least keep your account.",2

com.moonly.android,ivana,"It's cool app , but almost everything is premium and my parents don't want to pay that 😢 so I'm only using this app to see when it is fool moon so I can make moon water 😐",3
com.moonly.android,Dakota Collins,The moon phase for my area is wrong and so is the sign the moon is in. You can't change it on the app. It's a shame how many people are using this app and getting false information,1
com.moonly.android,Drago's Garden,Beautiful design but most of this information is easily obtainable elsewhere for free. I hope you will eventually find a niche that makes the app unique as it definitely has potential.,2
com.moonly.android,Marie Court,"J'adore cette application, la première chose que je fais le matin est de l'ouvrir et de lire chaque petites information, les runes et ensuite une superbe méditation 🧘‍♀️ Merci beaucoup.",5

com.moonly.android,Deborah Foster,"I came back to revise my review bc with lots of frustration I was able to figure it out.

com.moonly.android,Heather Felldin,"Kinda sucks that in order to use this ""amazing app"" you have to buy a subscription or else you can't use it. Not free, so don't bother trying unless you want to pay. I was really excited to try it over another but I guess not.",1
com.moonly.android,Ciara Tatum,I love this app! if you're a moonchild that knows you ebb and flow by the whim of the moon then this app is for you!,5
com.moonly.android,Yo Mayo,"I really like it, but you have to pay to use most of the stuff and it really sucks, also I've really wanted to put an option for the app to notify me whenever there's an important moon phase but i couldn't find one, overall the app is great if you don't want much or uf you're willing to pay monthly/yearly to get access to everything",2

com.moonly.android,Natalie Bullion,"wish I had the option to opt out of runes in favor of something more culturally relevant to me, but otherwise I like it very much",4
com.moonly.android,Amanda J,Don't bother! If you don't subscribe then you'll have VERY limited access to the features. Isn't personalized to birthday's so how can you get accurate readings!,1
com.moonly.android,Sarah Elledge,The main page refuses to load for weeks now. I've sent a message to support and heard nothing back. Can't use it if nothing loads.,1
com.moonly.android,Shawnee Stevens,"sometimes glitchy but fun and interesting, make sure to adjust notifications settings, I get more than one a day otherwise and it gets annoying",4
com.moonly.android,Rose,"Very nice app, great for beginners, one thing though- the moon calendar is a day behind. I recommend getting another app for that if it's something you value",4
com.moonly.android,eternal moth,"Not bad but the calendar main page will not load at all, it's been 3 days now. I only get the daily affirmation page and the rune page, the rest wont load Edit: it works fine now thank you 💕. I highly recommend this app, so many great features and ZERO ADS, I'm not even premium, I'm using the free version and no ads at all. It's amazing, i will get premium they deserve it, everything looks so beautiful and calm. I advise people to try it",5
com.moonly.android,Kylie Kemp,"This app didn't even let me put in my birthday. I'm not sure if it is grabbing it from my Google account or anything but none of seems to be personalized towards me. All the wording is all over the place too, its like it wasnt made for my pgone. I have tried uninstalling and reloading but its not changing. I downloaded it because it was one of Google plays top 2021 apps but I am starting to think they either paid someone to be on that list or didn't really have a lot of competition.",1
com.moonly.android,Victoria Sigler,Do not buy a thing. You will be charged over and over again.,1
com.moonly.android,Anthony M. Paduano,"Easy to use, you can get alot of material without a subscription, and the Healing portion with the audio clips is very deeply relaxing .. I enjoyed it very much",5

com.moonly.android,Bianca Almeida,"I love this app, but recently, since the update, I haven't been able to use the calendar at all. It's stuck on the loading screen. I tried restarting my phone, closing the app, and tried using it without wifi. Nothing has worked",4

com.moonly.android,Amanda Gardner,"Lovely app with useful info. Visually beautiful, it's a joy to look at.",5
com.moonly.android,Fiona Vining,How to delete subscription,1
com.moonly.android,Labat Mélanie,after paying for the subscription I'm not able to see anything at all a bit disappointed as I was thinking it was quite well made beforehand and paid to get the full on experience .,2
com.moonly.android,Heather West,Loved the app until I got a new phone and it didn't transfer over. I've tried contacting them multiple times with no response. So disappointed I spent the money for nothing.,1
com.moonly.android,Cassie Kerr,"I've had this app for a while now and I've loved it... up until the new update went in. Sometimes it doesn't load, and I cannot get into the wisdom window at all. It's just blank. There's also runes that are locked? Yet I have a lifetime fully paid membership. I'm a little disappointed that this has happened.",3
com.moonly.android,First Last,Must pay to use app,1
com.moonly.android,Hue Jorgan,This is the best app if you are in to these things. It overdelivers by ten fold.,5
com.moonly.android,Beverly Shook,love love love MOONLY!,5
com.moonly.android,Charlene Coscarelli,"Its not free, does not say till u install it",1
com.moonly.android,Brenda Farias,"Would be perfect if there were less notifications. When I first got the app I only got one notification about my daily affirmation which was PERFECT. But it seems like there might be been an update a couple weeks ago, and now I get 3-5 notifications a day, which is excessive.",4
com.moonly.android,Alicia Price,Every month after my payment goes through I have to uninstall and reinstall the app so all of my features are unlocked,3
com.moonly.android,Kim Davis,"I love this! It gives you a moon calendar, affirmations, meditations, teaches you runes, and so much more. I tried the one month subscription, and I like that you really don't need to pay for it if you don't want to, but it does give you more things for each day. You can also skip around days to see what's coming up this week, what to expect, etc. Once my month is up I will be getting the lifetime subscription. At $30 it's a steal for everything it provides!",5
com.moonly.android,Seema Kunder,Doesn't work 🤷🏽‍♀️ despite a paid subscription,1
com.moonly.android,Matthew James,This app is freakin awesome!,5
com.moonly.android,Polly Shelley,It is a lovely app but different than expected as is based on Vedic/eastern astrology. I find the daily rune option helpful and the meditations are very good. I also especially like the wisdom section as it teaches a lot. There is a small subscription needed to access everything of 2.99 per month but its definitely worth the subscription for what it offers.,4
com.moonly.android,Claudia Argi S.,I can't load many of the articles especially the rituals and healing section. Why is that?,1
com.moonly.android,Karla Rey,"I haven't used the meditation feature. But something good about it, is that thank to this app it has helped me understand how the moon and me works. I just couldn't understand why I was feeling bad. And it was because of the eclipse! So awesome.",5
com.moonly.android,Vasia mlt,I love this app is soo gooddd,5
com.moonly.android,J L Nation,love how it's set up its cool and it looks like it will be just what I needed.,5
com.moonly.android,Robert SD,Uninstalled immediately as the design and format is unclear and could cause you to subscribe inadvertently.,1
com.moonly.android,Meena Moorthy,"I love this app but it sometimes shows me that certain aspects are locked, despite me being in a monthly payment. Please fix this. I sent an email but there was no reply, it's been more than a month.",4
com.moonly.android,Robin Beaird,I just started using the app but like what I see so far..,3
com.moonly.android,Ray Ray,I do like the app I just wish I could view previous affirmations and to add now I can't view anything on the wisdom tab 🙄,3
com.moonly.android,Rebecca S,"I absolutely love it! The daily affirmations alone are amazing, but everything from the artwork to the music, I just love it! I wanted to try adding something new to my daily self love routine, this is perfect! I do wish their was a free trial to check out everything the ap has to offer, but the price isn't bad at all. I will definitely be using it to go forward with my spiritual journey. Thank you!",5
com.moonly.android,Kristin Frederick,They keep removing my review and still have not fixed the issue or replied to my email. At this point I consider the app to be fake. Others have stated they're paying for features and not getting what they paid for. The app has potential but the developers and customer service are not top notch as their reply to my review was before it was removed. Unprofessional!,1
com.moonly.android,Kerri Woolard,I love this app. I was waiting to see how much I used it before I paid for the lifetime. I like looking at my rune for the day and the daily affirmations. 🥰😍,5
com.moonly.android,Amy K,Free version - need to click the x on the upper left corner. It's very faint but the developer explained it. Kudos to them for explaining.,5
com.moonly.android,Ana Firta,amazing app,5
com.moonly.android,Victoria Duhaime,"Love the notifications, just wish more were open to the free version",5
com.moonly.android,Nick Jones,beautiful,5
com.moonly.android,Devi Grieser,I love this app. I have learned so much about stuff I thought I knew everything about. It is fun if you are in to this kind of stuff and the meditations are super soothing...,5
com.moonly.android,deven haigis,The free version of this app is pretty limited and annoying. It's probably great if you want to pay $30/year. Meh.,1
com.moonly.android,Natalie Z,really love this app at first didn't use it but since I started using liked it so much I paid for it. Very interesting and educational!,5
com.moonly.android,Logan Wyrd,Like the idea but focuses too heavily on women. It should have sections for the male counterparts.,3
com.moonly.android,Britnei Tweedy,Nothing free about it as advertised. Cannot do anything at all unless you pay between $3.99-$29.99 plus tax depending on the plan. Thought at least part of this app would be free.... since it was advertised as free but it isn't... uninstalled!!!!,1
com.moonly.android,Lori Krieger,"This app is really nice for those just starting out! For those that are just getting into witchcraft or interested in reiki/astrology having all of it in one place! But I find that the app leans too heavily on eastern astrology which gets a little confusing if you just jump right in and doesn't let you choose between west and east. But I feel the app is well made, and subscription price isn't bad for one year, just not for me :)",4
com.moonly.android,Claire Keen,rubbish... was hoping for daily spells ect waste of money... tells you when to get your hair cut... pffffttt.... also the beautiful graphics on the advert are hardly used... don't bother...,1
com.moonly.android,Leanna S,Love this app. The meditations are nice and daily affirmation is perfect. I also enjoy the moon updates. I used the free version for a few months and recently upgraded to a lifetime.,5
com.moonly.android,Miel Miel,"This is a rare app based on sidereal zodiac, which I am always looking for. I like the information it gives, pretty handy. There are functions behind a paywall that I won't be trying. My one complaint is that it doesn't interface right with the settings from the app Big Font, which I use to increase text size to reduce eye strain since I get frequent migraines. The text gets bigger but the problem is it doesn't allow scrolling so part of the message is cut off. Please fix this/add scrolling 😭",4
com.moonly.android,Maiada Welther,Really amazing,5
com.moonly.android,Chris Ford,Love it. At first I thought I had to pay to use it. I was contacted and they let me know that it actually is a free app with an option to pay to unlock all of the features.,5
com.moonly.android,Kate Roz,"I really enjoy this app, especially the meditations, but also everything else",4
com.moonly.android,Christina Maytham,Love this app. It gives me guidance every day,5

com.moonly.android,Katie King,Uplifting and Spot on helps understands the things i feel and forces me to see a positive aspiration each day,5
com.moonly.android,Maureen Bowling,They fixed the issue with the app crashing whenever a meditation was opened. I love this app and am so thankful it's fixed because I really don't find guided meditations that align so well with my needs like these ones do! Thank you very much Moonly!,5
com.moonly.android,Ashley Christian,love this app,5
com.moonly.android,Lori Ard,"I was slightly disappointed, I thought that if you paid for the locked info that some of the categories would become specific to your information, but that is not the case. In fact, you never put in your astrological and other information. Its just basic information about a subject that you can do research on fir free. However, the information is a good place to start and they do have some music. The affirmations and moon cycles are free and thats the only new, daily info as far as I can see.",3
com.moonly.android,Sandy Coffman,"I really enjoy this app! It has a lot of good information, I'm not much of a reader... but I've enjoyed doing so here.",5
com.moonly.android,Asha M,Most of the things in this app are behind the paywall that continuously pops up. This makes the free trial difficult to use.,1

com.moonly.android,Ariyah Kimberlynn,I wish I could write your app a better review it looked promising! But I couldn't even make a account when I was blocked by it saying to retry my internet connection which is at 5 bars and is perfectly fine? I kept on restarting the app and it kept on saying it.,1
com.moonly.android,Padmini Debbarma,"I paid for monthly subscription, amount got deducted from my account but is not being subscription. I can't get access to the new features. Technical issues are there with the app",2

com.moonly.android,Noya Buisness,not that great thought it was better then that,1
com.moonly.android,Josh,"Epic! Actual real info. Newage is a bad moniker as it's actually 'old age' info forgotten to Western societies. the information is clear concise and direct, and definitely tickles me in my woo woo meter.

com.moonly.android,Amb sandoval,Have to pay to do anything. I tried to look at what it offers but refuse to buy something that won't give me info or even a limited idea of what to expect. Maybe it's worth the money but I won't find out before ever using the app,1
com.moonly.android,Dante Atlas,"I seem to be experiencing a bug where whenever I try to open a meditation audio, the app force closes itself. Restarting my phone and uninstalling then reinstalling the app didn't help. Other than that, the app is cool. It's just frustrating that I can't do meditations.",3
com.moonly.android,Sally Gentry,"It's absolutely lovely, easy to use, and full of interesting information. It took a little while for me to actually delve into it, but once I did I was pleasantly surprised. Not too much info to leave your head spinning, and it all makes sense.

I have used this app for a few days and I already feel more connected to myself and to my spirituality. I will absolutely be paying for a membership to see how else this amazing app can enhance my life! Thank you",5
com.moonly.android,Sunyi MNT,"There are some free stuff, but everything is revolving around a paywall. You want to learn more about a rune? You have to pay. You want to see what it will be like tomorrow? You have to pay. I get the need for payment, but I feel like this is too much, and the popup to select a payment method just comes up too often.",3

The illustrations are beautiful and the information is presented in a very thoughtful way. Tonight I discovered the healing music, it was wonderful.

I’ve also gone to the website (free to use software) the developers have linked to in replies to other comments about the moon calendar and the information on maker's of this app and the website linked do not match. So there is indeed an issue with the app. So it's a real shame that the developers don't seem to want to fix this issue. Edit after reply: guess you didn't read my whole review then.,3

com.moonly.android,Ashley Hegel,Would love to give a better rating cause free version is useful but seems like developers of this app like to double charge you and not provide premium access.

com.moonly.android,Socks Knitter,Please let us turn off vibration. For people who have certain sensitivities it can be an unpleasant feeling.,4
com.moonly.android,Allison Barone,This app is beautiful. Love taking a moment in am to see how things might go. The haircut vibe is the best. Only thing is not sure its accurate with real moon timing. Last month was the full blue moon and guess I expected some info about but it wasn't even a full moon on app. Maybe I am just new to the whole moon concept.,5

com.moonly.android,Sarah Ingalls,"Ok but more astrology and not moon phases. I really wanted an app to track the phases of the moon, waxing crescent, waning gibbons, etc. This is all just astrology cycles not moon specific enough.",2

com.moonly.android,Devyn Burgess,"A wonderful app where all sorts of knowledge - both ancient and new - come to light in ways we can use to better ourselves and enhance daily life and routines. Especially enlightening for women, learning how to go with the flow of lunar cycles is vital to connecting with inner divinity and femininity.

com.moonly.android,Jamie Provencher,love this app,5
com.moonly.android,Elizabeth Lee,Best astrological app I've ever used. So much wealth of information it's unreal I have taken classes that have taught less than this app has taught me.

com.moonly.android,Holistically Rosie,"Love it, really uplifting to check in each day.

com.moonly.android,Carrie Davis,It has some good thing . But I originally bought the app to let me know when the moon was full and to remind me of the different moons. This app isn't what I believed it to be. I wish this app had a setting to remind owner of full moons or the option for the other phases.,2
com.moonly.android,Sheri Ferguson,best moon and astrology app I've tried. .and I've tried ALOT,5
com.moonly.android,Tiffany Elkins,"Not as advertised and I had to pay for it before I knew I was going to delete it, right after I downloaded it.",1
com.moonly.android,Amanda Landsverk,I'm new to the app but so far I think that Moonly is a fantastic and engaging app! It gives you tons of info in such a perfectly presented way that it makes what you're learning fun and easy to retain.

com.moonly.android,Debby Lacy,Very interesting information and who doesn't want to know if it's a good day for a hair cut.,5
com.moonly.android,Sophie *,Most of the rune info is inaccurate. Literally no reason to include it especially since the broader vibe of the app is eastern. Rune row isn't even in order.,2

com.moonly.android,30 Mallo,🦋PERFECT🦋,5
com.moonly.android,Monika Biskup,I like this app so far. Love the amount of information and the meditations and sounds are a superb addition. I'm wondering if there is a way to change the lunar calendar to IST (Irish standard time) zone as on this part the full moon is on 24th July while the lunar calendar shows 23rd July for US time zone. That would make this app so much better since I did pay for subscription,4
com.moonly.android,Mimosa Basu,As a moon follower & tracker this app appeals to me. But wish there was a monthly trial to see how the app functions. Eager to know more,4

com.moonly.android,Arbor Byrd,"The update changed a lot of visual elements that I was in love with... And also, the astrology portion is... Sadly incorrect. Every time I cross reference it with other sources online, they're all consistent, and Moonly is consistently inaccurate. For example: this month's full moon is in Aquarius, not in Capricorn. But all of the wisdom and additional features are definitely worth their own set of five stars. It's a shame it's so off target, and I wish I knew how to adjust it.",3
com.moonly.android,Carrie,Beautiful app. Disappointed that I can not learn more without a subscription.,3
com.moonly.android,Victoria K,my favorite app.,5

com.moonly.android,Lisa DiMascio,"My review somehow was removed so im dropping the stars to a 2. My review that was removed was saying it's a good app but it only has Hindu gods that corresponds to the moons which again, isn't my thing and they should add other gods/goddess/ deities to be inclusive.",2
com.moonly.android,Phavinee Thongma,I kept getting the same affirmation again and again. I thought that it will be new affirmation everyday. This is a waste of money.,1
com.moonly.android,Alex Lighthall,Current moon sign is wrong and you need a sub to see anything,1
com.moonly.android,Emma Preston,"Not many free features, not enough demo to decide ifnit is worth thr commitment. Good idea though.",1
com.moonly.android,Kiara Creatives TV,Git the full access for this app. I would appreciate this app even more if this can make it more personal for each individual according to their birth zodiac or year zodiac. :),3
com.moonly.android,VanGhle 61,"Personally I love this app; I even purchased the lifetime subscription. Yes, it follows the sidereal zodiac, but that is part of why I use it. I have another that uses tropical; I like to follow both. The daily affirmation, the daily rune, the healing sounds & the info articles are all nice additions. I use this to plan my next day& I find the addition of holidays & ekadashi on the calendar very useful. My only gripe is that I prefer the old look/layout versus the one from this new update.",4
com.moonly.android,Lauren Petersen,just discovering this app,5
com.moonly.android,Stephanie Dolliver,"It doesn't actually tell you the moon phase, it just gives you really basic knowledge about some things. I still can't find where to end my subscription and have not heard back from them, which is also really annoying.",2
com.moonly.android,Greta Gladkowski,Easy to use. Just wish there was a traditional horoscope section included.,4
com.moonly.android,Lisa Marie Dunne,It's not filtered to your own personal information so pretty useless,1
com.moonly.android,Maxine Carrasco,"It's okay. I thought this app would tell you the moon phase your in like waxing gibbous etc but I guess I was mistaken, it only shows a picture. Also the rituals and stuff are general information does not go in depth on actual rituals and spells. Decent for beginners.",3
com.moonly.android,Moon Odinson,J'adore,5
com.moonly.android,Dattatreya Mekala,Amazing,5
com.moonly.android,Samantha Edwards,"The app is working now, however it was a pain to get here. The subscription wouldn't load at first. when it did, it wouldn't connect to my paid account. I've heard good things about this app which is the only reason I kept trying. Normally I would have canceled it for lack of simplicity during sign up.",3
com.moonly.android,Lydia,This app sucks. You have to pay $3/mth to get any real content. It's pretty artificial information. Don't bother.,2
com.moonly.android,Sarah Nicole,amazing! very positive thoughts!,5
com.moonly.android,Laura Crawford,"Nice app and layout, some nice information for beginners, but the moon and sign calibration is off, which doesn't give me the confidence to want to move forward with a purchase. At a very minimum in the free version that should be correct.",2
com.moonly.android,Nakia Dow,Generic information. I was under the impression that it was customized. It wasn't until after I signed up that I discovered this.,2
com.moonly.android,Amy Brunn,Just aqeful!,1
com.moonly.android,Gini Lyon,Not sure exactly what I'm paying for but it's a nice little app w/ some bizarre little facts which makes it really interesting. All in all 4 starts is enough I think.,4
com.moonly.android,D. L. M. M.,Great app! Keeps me up to date with lunar and celestial events. Tons of information and tips for self care and other topics. There's more but I felt the subscription is worth it. 2.99 is a great deal for a one stop shop of tools and information.,5
com.moonly.android,Chanelle Strutt,"I would give this app 5 stars if the option to change subscription and log in from different devices was an option. I want to buy the lifetime subscription. I did the monthly so I could trial it. Now I can't buy it for the lifetime. I love this app. I use it every day. I love the information, the affirmations, the daily rune. Everything. Really sucks that it isn't interchangeable seeing as I go through phones alot. Please make this an option. Like give a log in or account number access",4
com.moonly.android,joi tuffy,"great app! I had an issue where I subscribed and it wasn't letting me in, I went to my Google play store and simply updated the app! but yes this app really does have alot of good info, affirmations, advice. 10/10",5
com.moonly.android,Billie D,can't really do anything without subscription. Everything is locked down. What's the point of this app? people like to see functions of the app before they pay for it. Poor app design.,1
com.moonly.android,B3337,NOT FUNCTIONAL WITHOUT PAYING $2.99 A MONTH SUBSCRIPTION. YOU CAN ONLY SEE VERY LIMITED INFORMATION. TOTALLY USELESS AND I'M NOT PAYING.,1

com.moonly.android,Boogalingous,"You have to subscribe and for what it is, it's way too much money.",1
com.moonly.android,Amanda Rubin,"Terrible. There is no option to preview any of the features. You get a short tutorial and then have to pay before you can explore the app. There is an x in the corner of the payment screen, but clicking it does nothing. Could be a great app, but I'll never know.",1

com.moonly.android,Bonnie Rabalais,Beautifully done and so much more information than I realized. Love this!,5
com.moonly.android,Martienne Vélo,"Love the paid version! There are so many great resources, and I love the daily information. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because they got rid of the haircut calendar. I depended on that because of the reasons I'm growing my hair. That was one of the main reasons I went with this app.",4
com.moonly.android,Rhonda Thomassen,"It looks cool, but no free trial that I can see, so nope.",3
com.moonly.android,Trixi Burke,Why doesn't this app work for me? I even paid the monthly price and still won't let me get rid of that stupid screen.. so unsubscribing and uninstalling.. my daughter uses the free version perfectly fine,1
com.moonly.android,Denis M.,Why free information on the web needs to cost on an app??? Dont understand it.,2
com.moonly.android,Aleya Harris,"Not personalized using your birthday, place and time. Not as accurate as I would like.",3

com.moonly.android,Lenoir Rice,Looked great at the beginning but I can't figure out how to cancel my subscription. Not user friendly when you want information like that,2
com.moonly.android,Chelsae Bacon,so many amazing things about this app! I love it!,5
com.moonly.android,Helen Parlow,"Decent app, but I see nothing of herbs and... Are all the messages the same for everyone?? Because the same messages don't apply to everyone. No way to personalize the app far as I can tell, no way to make a profile. But you charge a monthly subscription?? Yeah. I'm at like a 9 out of 10 on the ""do I cancel?"" scale. Actually, kind of pretty disappointed. 😟",2
com.moonly.android,Anastasya Gorelik,Just a best app ever! Everything I was looking for in one app. There is so many useful info I didn't even imagine I was looking for... Thanks!!,5
com.moonly.android,Linda Oliva,This app is so uplifting and full of great information! I'm so glad to have been guided to it❤,5
com.moonly.android,Becka Ward,super easy to use and totally worth the money!,5
com.moonly.android,Angel Flores,Cool. But seems only Android users have to pay. ios apple users get the app for free,3
com.moonly.android,Kaitlyn Seabrook,"Downloaded, but the app just closes when you open it. So who knows. 1 star for nothing",1
com.moonly.android,Ashley White,I loved this app. I paid for a lifetime subscription and now it's asking me to pay again and has everything locked. I've sent several emails and no response. Highly disappointing.,1
com.moonly.android,Stephanie Greenhalgh,"Only purchased a week ago, but loving the daily moon vibe, affirmation and rune. Super cool app.",5
com.moonly.android,Lena F,"I love the calendar but don't like that the free version only allows you to see the current day. Besides that, the app doesn't use proper timing as it doesn't have settings to enter your location nor asks for permissions from Android for your location - what makes me conclude it's not properly timed. I downloaded another app from the store to see a proper date for the Ekadashi fast that asked for location data and it gave me different results! This makes all the other days questionable also!",2
com.moonly.android,Dana K,Don't waste your time or money! Very little information.,1
com.moonly.android,Amber Grace,"Offers no personalization, and all information is available on any website. This is not what the ads showed.",1
com.moonly.android,Maddie,It's a good app but mostly everything is locked,2
com.moonly.android,Jen Duceour,Not accurate. LOL what's the point of this app if it says the Moon is in Pisces when it's actually in Aries? That's the entire point of it.,1
com.moonly.android,Holli Hexen,Soon as I download this app they start asking me for money can even use it because it keep asking me for money I will never get this app ever,1
com.moonly.android,Berekah,"There is tons of amazing stuff in this app! It's soooo much more than moon phases! A great tool for spiritual knowledge and guidance. It is also written very well, subjects and techniques for real self improvement are explained so clearly. The different audio selections are superb. With the purest, high quality sounds and meditations. Thry truely resonated with me!",5
com.moonly.android,Tracy Jacobs,absolutely love this app,5
com.moonly.android,Noel Tippel,I don't understand why I have to pay a monthly subscription. It should be a one time payment and nothing more.,1

com.moonly.android,Josh Demyanovich,"I've only had Moonly a few days and I already love it. There's so much content, I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface. I've used other astrology apps but just the way this one presents the information to you is so pleasing and intuitive.",5

com.moonly.android,Cindy Zulema Escobar Schmidt,"amazing, helpful app!",5
com.moonly.android,Zaquoya Tinsley,Love it so much.... I was looking for a beautiful app that is Sidereal!! This is awesome and worth the 3 dollars a month. So much to it!!,5
com.moonly.android,Sara-Marie Miller,Doesn't tell you what the actual moon phase is,3
com.moonly.android,Caitlin Ness,"Absolutely my new favorite app. very, very thoughtfully put together. Great job to creators!! And I NEVER rate apps.",5
com.moonly.android,Amethyst Blossom,"For an app that wants you to subscribe, it's less than mediocre. everything on this app can be accessed for free elsewhere. I can't figure out how to cancel my subscription. Don't waste your money. There's not even any personalization, or birth chart. This app is definitely not recommended. I am extremely frustrated with the fact that I can't cancel my subscription through settings. I read through other reviews and I am not interested in any special offer as I am not impressed with the app.",1
com.moonly.android,Nicie Newlin,"Was very interested in this but when I finally went to try it out you IMMEDIATELY get taken to a select a payment thing doesn't even give you a free trial. I'm not paying without trying it out for at least a couple days, sorry.",1
com.moonly.android,Kristi Cashman,Beautiful artwork in the app and I am so impressed with all of the features,5
com.moonly.android,Roxie Castelan,You literally cant do ANYTHING without paying a monthly fee. Laaammmeeee,1
com.moonly.android,Tazzi P,"Great app, easy to use and full of lots of helpful information and extras for a variety of spiritual followings, however you're unable to change your geographical location (eg the next full moon isn't on Tuesday as listed, it's on Thursday for me due to where I live) so the info isn't as helpful as it could be. I wish you could change your location so the info was fully accurate, I unfortunately had to purchase the full app to discover this wasn't a thing.",3
com.moonly.android,Heather Marie Driscoll,this app is amazing!,5
com.moonly.android,Louise Avril,"Looks good, however I downloaded it first before I knew there was a monthly subscription. That's not on. Maybe offer a free trial. Or a proper purchase price.",3
com.moonly.android,Lillian Bujniewicz,pretty good so far,5
com.moonly.android,Michelle Solomon,"Love the app, but it's telling me it is a full moon tonight but everyone is reporting a full blood moon tomorrow",3
com.moonly.android,Derek french,includes the eclipse for tomorrow may 26th 2021 but does not include the super blood moon we will be experiencing on the east coast,3

com.moonly.android,hippiemama1189,I love this app! It's easy to navigate and so cute! Very informatinal too.,5
com.moonly.android,Elizabeth Mayorga,Pretty but without value,1
com.moonly.android,Thera Lynn 85,amazing information & amazing selection of self teaching,5
com.moonly.android,Mackenzie Morgan,I like the app but it isn't as cool and interactive as the advertisement shows. I wouldn't have purchased the lifetime app if I would have know.,1
com.moonly.android,Tara Penney,You have to pay for almost everything. Not much free at all really.,2
com.moonly.android,Raven Childers,Great information,5
com.moonly.android,JuJu Jurate,"This app is affordable, aesthetically pleasing, and informative. Finally something that genuinely is very useful for my craft. Thank you.",5
com.moonly.android,DIANA VON NUNGARAY,pretty lame.,1
com.moonly.android,Naomi Palmer,"Looks interesting but one should be able to have a look at this app 7 day trial or something before having to decide if i want to buy ..I like to explore apps first, see if it suits my needs/wants before investing.. i would consider the lifetime one if I liked it. I will explore what I can, and if I buy into this. I will rate again accordingly. 2 stars cause this looks interesting..",2
com.moonly.android,Sarah Dube,"Super pretty app and could be a great tool however the dates are wrong for the moon phases (according to NASA and the farmers almanac, which I follow) that's a huge negative for me. Will not be renewing next month",1
com.moonly.android,Lisa Hatfield,"I'd love to be able to trial this app, it looks to cover a lot of areas that other apps miss. Edit: Thanks. It would be great if there was a way of personalising the app and tailoring daily 'readings' to the user. It's a good app for general affirmations and meditations, although I've noticed no inclusion of LGBT+ in relationship/female meditation, or even just neutral terms.",3
com.moonly.android,T Maure,Cute app but doesn't tell you the name of the moon phase we are in. Like is tonight a waning moon or a new moon? Percentage of lumination would be great as well.,4
com.moonly.android,Mollie Tucker,IN LOVE. Yay i use this as a ritualistic tool💜,5
com.moonly.android,Elizabeth Grech,Would be nice to to experience full use of the app rather than the very small part that is free for a trial period so I know whether it's worth investing in for a lifetime.,3
com.moonly.android,Paula Hartwig,"love it, best calender app",5
com.moonly.android,I'sha Clinton,Bought the lifetime membership!,5

com.moonly.android,Louisa Beckett,"Covers so many different aspects of holism & spiritual well being, with deep and thorough knowledge. Quickly becoming my go-to app for all things wicca and holistic. Beautifully presented. I can tell a lot of work and effort has gone into this app, where others are left lacking, in both information and regular (useful) daily updates. Simply put....so much more than just the moon.",5
com.moonly.android,tania hernando,No lo que esperaba las secciones son artículos,2
com.moonly.android,Felisha Fulk,I've read the mission and faq and liked on Facebook but 5 stars anyway because I'm already interested to explore the app more and I love astrology 😊,5
com.moonly.android,Gwen Hooper,This app is not free. Requires a monthly subscription as soon as you open it. Misleading.,1

com.moonly.android,Jose Herrera,I bought the lifetime version on my old phone but I can’t get it restored on my new phone. How do I do this?,4
com.moonly.android,Yael Plat,Disappointing,1
com.moonly.android,Amethyst A,Very uninformative. Lots of opinions rather than astrological facts. Not impressed,1
com.moonly.android,AllwaysMae Prevatt,I was very excited to find this app. the amount of information they give you along with my other apps I feel like I'm in astrological know group. I have recommended it to others.,5
com.moonly.android,stephanie winn,this app is great!! so informative... no bubblegum fluff like a lot of other spiritual apps. it's also very easy to read and nice to look at.,5
com.moonly.android,Jimmy Jon,Loveley app super beautiful design very infromational and decent price for life time buy,5
com.moonly.android,Super Ny,beautiful app tells you what and where the moon is and it's effects 😀,5
com.moonly.android,Drea Savage,"I went for broke and paid for the lifetime version. Which, I might add, is a very fair price. So far, it's the most informative app I've found, with everything in one spot. Mind you, I still practice by intuition and books but having a handy app is a helpful tool as well. 💜🔮",5
com.moonly.android,Daisy,It's a very good app however you have to pay for most of the stuff which isn't something I can do. Lots of information.,3
com.moonly.android,danielle gleeson,"I love it, I wish they would add a round calendar with the seasonal holidays",4
com.moonly.android,ThatCrustyRat,"Not great, don't get me wrong the design is beautiful but the content ehhh you have to pay for so many things and the voice thingy doesn't work for me. I know the company needs money but still more than half of the content is with played access I'm pretty sure.",1
com.moonly.android,Brandi,Super helpful. Beautiful art. Ideas for rituals of all kinds. Amazing app for baby witches wanting to learn the moon cycles and holiday rituals!,5
com.moonly.android,Donna Dodd,best paid app i have!!!,5
com.moonly.android,vale Martínez,"Creo que lejos es una de las mejores app q conozco, te enseña mucho, tiene muchas cosas, sonidos, es muy informativa en todo ámbito espiritual y tiene el ciclo lunar.

com.moonly.android,Jade Perry,Great and informative app!,5
com.moonly.android,Presh 01,love this app definitely seen an improvement in my life since using it,5
com.moonly.android,Tasmin Winchester,Kind of a pointless app,2
com.moonly.android,May Rico,"Not ""freemium"" like they say they are. That means you get some basic functionality for free and then have to pay to unlock other features. This is a straight-up subscription app. You can't do anything without paying a monthly subscription.",1
com.moonly.android,Victoria Blunt,"The app is nicely layed out and for the free version it is still useful, but it seem with the last Android phone update the app won't get past the loading screen. I hope this will be fixed soon!",3
com.moonly.android,Catalina Escobar Cabrejo,Hi.. in free version is really nice but... before start de premium version I would like to know how is the female calendar and how it crosses with moon phases. Thnks 🥰,4
com.moonly.android,Roshani Shenazz,New - ITS 3 WEEKS & YOU HAVENT REPLIED WHY my subscription is cancelled after paying up.. Can you please share what's the issue?,1

com.moonly.android,Amanda Yesilbursa,I love this app. But I don't seem to have the Meditation function despite the 21 April update. Any ideas why??? Update: All problems resolved (6 May 2021). Thank you Moonly🌒🌕🌘,5

com.moonly.android,Abby Amesty,😒,1
com.moonly.android,Fantom,"Great design, easy to use, and very informative! However, the moon calender is not completely free as supposedly stated. In the past I've been able to scroll through the calender and see the future moon phases and information (i use it for my weekly planners), however now I get a pop up that I cannot use the full calender without payment. While the payment is pretty cheap, I find it inconvenient that the full calender access has changed. It is a good app, I recommend it, but not entirely free.",3
com.moonly.android,Ilaria Tartaglione,"[ANDROID] Free version is OK - you have the daily affirmation, the daily rune and some meditation sounds. However, the zodiac of the lunar phases is wrong so I won't keep the app, i prefer to use Moon because it's accurate",2
com.moonly.android,Shan Dinnie,No southern hemisphere option,2
com.moonly.android,Doriana Proca,Absolutely love the app! ❤❤❤,5
com.moonly.android,Suzanne James-Fulner,"App is not ""Free."" Upon installation and loading, you are treated to some lovely, nondescript sample screens and a pay wall. No trial. No basic features. Seems purposely misleading. Would rate zero stars if allowed.",1

com.moonly.android,Mary Green,Love this. Will learn more as I go. Just downloaded today!,5
com.moonly.android,Lisa Gilham,It's the most basic of apps. No specific times so that really doesn't help at all.I paid for a month but I am uninstalling.Waste of money.,2
com.moonly.android,Mary Vodvarka,Confusing. How do I unsubscribe????,1
com.moonly.android,Jessika Masters,This app uses stolen and altered artwork. This is completely unacceptable. EDIT TO ADD: reproduced and copied art does not mean it was created by you. The art on your app is a direct recreation of an artist I have been following for years. You're damn right it's unacceptable. I commented on your facebook post and it was deleted. If I could give this app 0 stars I would.,1
com.moonly.android,Jess Storm,Only paid options but it doesn't show up as a paid app,1
com.moonly.android,Stephanie Hobbs,Be forewarned the app only works if you sign up for a subscription. Not wasting my money on this when there are free apps that are just as informative.,1
com.moonly.android,Autumn Claxton,It never loaded past the first screen.,1
com.moonly.android,Crista,Very complete and useful!,5
com.moonly.android,Maya Funck,You have to pay for literally any of the things you would download this app for. Kinda pointless tbh,1
com.moonly.android,Rebecca Faas,"I paid for a year but don't want an auto renewal, it does not give me that option so if I want to cancel how do I do that?",3
com.moonly.android,Autumn Collins,Not much info.a real waste of money,1
com.moonly.android,Renee Fournel,This app has so much potential and I'm hoping more is coming onto it. I paid for the year and it will be useful for the moon cycles but the rest is very basic.,3
com.moonly.android,Jamie McClendon,Eh. It's okay. The calendar section is cool but the wisdom section is a series of what essentially amounts to a powerpoint. I thought it was going to be more along the lines of putting the stuff into practice but it's just telling you small tidbits of information about the subject. The daily affirmation is nice but I can get that elsewhere for free. I wish I hadn't bought the subscription. It's not worth it.,2

com.moonly.android,Jersey Hoogerwerf,"I had a lot of trouble downloading the app... Just after it hits 100% it got back to uninstalled :/ After many attempts I finally succeeded to get it. It bugs quite often but it's a lovely app, the design is simple to understand and not filled with numerous information :)",3
com.moonly.android,Sage Tran,"it's a great app! I'd definitely recommend. I love the designs of the app, and the information in it. I'd recommend more stuff to add in to it. Idk if u have added angels, in it since I haven't looked thru all of it. I'd suggest adding how to talk to spirits, protection spells? or just helpful spells. I'd also would love if you would add like ""here is where u can get these items/ingredient"" or ""here are some other apps or websites where u can learn some new things abt this topic"".",5

com.moonly.android,Anastasia Sieracki,"Update!!! 5 stars!!! Thanks to the developers that updated the app for Android!!! I complained about it only working for Apple & not Android (now that I switched back). I love this app so much and use this daily! Loving the additional WISDOM information, so much more info than even before! Again thanks so much for the quick response and notification as well! Keep the great work & customer service. 🌒🌕🌘 Blessed Be ✨",5
com.moonly.android,Erica Golino Laguer,"I have an android and this app works perfectly. I have not experienced any glitches the other reviewers have mentioned. But it seems the content may be different from the apple app VS the android app. The settings are non existent, no videos, missing wisdom and no paid subscription section. Also, It seems to not have an update. The app has potential. I think it will improve for Android when they add all the same features the apple app has. Please update the Android app soon.",4
com.moonly.android,Stephanie Viani,"Stopped updating end of January. Last date I can get info for is Jan 30th. It defaults to Oct 26th, so I have to scroll through 3 months of days to even see that there are no new updates.",4

com.moonly.android,Ericka MacFarlane,"Not going to lie, downloaded the app on my iPhone and thought it was pretty cool so I went to put it on my android to purchase the pro version and was extremely let down. They might as well have produced two different apps, there is so much less on my android then the iPhone app had to offer. Won't be purchasing.",2
